Every task is in different folder. You will find single .js file with the sollution and some tests. It is enought to test with node.js or with the browser console.
I tried not to use regex. For some tasks I have two solutions - with and without regex.
In task 12 folder you will find index.html file, so you can start it and than press the button to see the result.
